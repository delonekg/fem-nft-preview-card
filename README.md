## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned to persevere and not give up. This challenge wasn't intense or that tough for me, but there's definitely some parts of the challenge which I struggled in. 

### Continued development

I'm aiming to learn more about semantic HTML and accessibility applied design. I'm hoping to learn more about CSS Flexbox & Grid. And overall become a better web developer.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) This documentation website has helped me figure out what CSS properties I should be using.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) Stackoverflow is a great website for asking questions if you're stuck!
